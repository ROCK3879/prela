# User stories

* The website was designed based on the concept of unusual as well as standard coffee flavors, which can rarely be found on the market in such an offer.
When you enter the home page, you can see a simple inscription "Coffee Time, a temple of unforgivable flavors" that immediately associates you with the pleasure of drinking coffee. On the home page, at the very top, you can find a navigation bar that takes you to the other pages (HOME, MENU, CONTACT).
At the bottom of the home page, you can find the address, social network icon, contact information, and clicking on the address opens a map of the location of the Coffee Time coffee bar.
